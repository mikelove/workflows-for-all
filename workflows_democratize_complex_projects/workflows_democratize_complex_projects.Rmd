# Data Science workflows that democratize complex projects

---

# What are complex projects?

I define complex projects as one that satifies __*at least one*__ of the following criterias:

--

- two, or more, people directly working on the analysis

--

- projects that involve two or more coding documents

--

- projects that involve analysis of medium/large data 

--

- projects where you are working on a remote machine

--

- projects that have many software or environment dependencies, or ones that are difficult or take a long time to install

# Concrete examples of problems that can occur in complex analyses

- An interesting result that you cannot recreate ðŸ˜ž

- Your email inbox is full of information related to the project that only you have access too

- Code that can only be run on one machine, *and you don't know why...*

- Activation time to becoming productive after taking a break from the project is hours to days

# Workflow features to mitigate chaos

1. Version Control

2. Executable analysis scripts & pipelines

3. Defined (and shippable) dependencies

*All of these features are a subset of those recommended by Hilary Parker in her 2016 [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/) paper*

# Workflow features to mitigate chaos

1. Version Control (*Git & GitHub*)

2. Executable analysis scripts & pipelines (*Python/R scripts & Make*)

3. Defined (and shippable) dependencies (*Docker*)

*All of these features are a subset of those recommended by Hilary Parker in her 2016 [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/) paper*

# 1. Version Control 

- Version control is a tool which archives changes to file(s) over time. 

- These changes are archived in a way that you can later revisit different time points in the project.

--

- Many version control tools also have features that facilitate collaboration.

--

- Git + GitHub are two of the most common softwares for version control (*and so this is where I draw my examples from*)

---

# Problem(s) mitigated by version control

**Problem:** An extremely interesting result that you cannot recreate ðŸ˜ž

--

**Solution**: Version the code **and** the output of the analysis 

----
--

**Problem:** Your email inbox is full of information related to the project that only you have access too

--

**Solution**: Use GitHub Issues for communications related to the project
