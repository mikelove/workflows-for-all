# Data Science workflows that democratize complex projects

---

# What are complex projects?

I define complex projects as one that satifies __*at least one*__ of the following criterias:

--

- two, or more, people directly working on the analysis

--

- projects that involve two or more coding documents

--

- projects that involve analysis of medium/large data 

--

- projects where you are working on a remote machine

--

- projects that have many software or environment dependencies, or ones that are difficult or take a long time to install

# Concrete examples of problems that can occur in complex analyses

- An interesting result that you cannot recreate ðŸ˜ž

- Your email inbox is full of information related to the project that only you have access too ðŸ˜«

- A small change to the analysis code requires re-running the entire thing, *and takes hours...* ðŸ˜§

- Activation time to becoming productive after taking a break from the project is hours to days ðŸ˜´

- Code that can only be run on one machine, *and you don't know why...* ðŸ˜µ

# How can we avoid such problems and chaos?

# Workflow features to mitigate chaos

1. Version Control

2. Executable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines

3. Defined (and shippable) dependencies

*All of these features are a subset of those recommended by Hilary Parker in her 2016 [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/) paper*

# Workflow features to mitigate chaos

1. Version Control (*Git &amp; GitHub*)

2. Executable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines (*Python/R scripts &amp; Make*)

3. Defined (and shippable) dependencies (*Docker*)

*All of these features are a subset of those recommended by Hilary Parker in her 2016 [Opinionated Analysis Development](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/) paper*

# 1. Version Control 

- Version control is a tool which archives changes to file(s) over time. 

- These changes are archived in a way that you can later revisit different time points in the project.

&lt;img src="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/play-changes.svg"&gt;

--

- Many version control tools also have features that facilitate collaboration.

--

- Git + GitHub are two of the most common softwares for version control (*and so this is where I draw my examples from*)

## Example problem solved by version control

**Problem:** An extremely interesting result that you cannot recreate ðŸ˜ž


**Solution**: Version the code **and** the output of the analysis

**Problem:** Your email inbox is full of information related to the project that only you have access too ðŸ˜«


**Solution**: Use GitHub Issues for communications related to the project

## Version control contributes to democratization of Data Science

- Non-data science collaborators/team members know where to find the latest (or earlier) version of the analysis (code and output)

- All collaborators/team members have access to all communications associated with the analysis

---

# 2. Executable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines

---
class: middle
## Example problem solved by executable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines

**Problem:** Activation time to becoming productive after taking a break from the project is hours to days ðŸ˜´

**Solution:** Record the order scripts need to be run in, and their arguments in one "driver" script/pipeline file.

## Create a recipe for your analysis

.pull-left[
### Script and literate code docs needed for analysis...
```
predict.py

report.ipynb

scrape_data.py

summarize.R

tidy_data.R
```
]


.pull-right[
### Order and arguments needed to run analysis:
```
python scrape_data.py 2019-05-31 raw.csv

Rscript tidy_data.R raw.csv clean.csv

Rscript summarize.R clean.csv summ.svg

python predict.py clean.csv predict.csv

jupyter nbconvert --to pdf report.ipynb
```
]

## Example problem solved by executable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines

**Problem:** A small change to the analysis code requires re-running the entire thing, *and takes hours...* ðŸ˜§

**Solution:** Use a smart dependency tree tool to only re-run the parts that needs to be updated.

# Ex---

EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT MAKE (AND RELATED TOOLS HERE)

ecutable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines contribute to democratization of Data Science

- Can be used by others to run/replicate the analysis

- Makes it easier to understand the landscape of the project and for others to contribute 

- Reduces *some* of the challenges/frustrations of working with larger data sets

---

# 3. Defined (and shippable) dependencies

DEFINE HOW DEPENDENCIES CAN BE SHARED (Software and environment)

---

# Chaos Problem(s) mitigated by defined (and shippable) dependencies

---

# Defined (and shippable) dependencies contribute to democratization of Data Science

---

# When to add these workflow features:

1. Version Control  
 - **ALWAYS**

2. Executable analysis scripts &amp; pipelines 
 - **When you start hiding code chunks/cells in your Rmd/Jupter notebook**

3. Defined (and shippable) dependencies 
 - **When doing remote computing or when you have tricky dependencies**
