## notes on _The democratization of data science education_

* **Main purpose of paper**. Primarily focused on the demcratization of data science via MOOCs, specifically the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. Compares the specialization to other DS programs. 
* **Intro**. Structure includes: What is the specialization (e.g. what courses are included), how it was built, and how many enrolled over time. 
* **defined principles**. This is useful for our paper because I think developing a good workflow follows a similar set of principles: 

> _"In the following sections we summarize the differences we think gave us an advantage and propose some ideas for the future of data science education. 
> Philosophical principles behind our innovations
> One of the key reasons for the successs of the Johns HOpkins Data Science Specialization is our focus on a few key principles: 
> 1. focusing on developing large quantities of quality open source content
> 2. targeting broad audiences as opposed to niche experts
> 3. thinking about the users of online education_"

* **Platforms**. I liked how they talked about the different types of platforms for the MOOCs. We could discuss the different types of platforms for workflows. Could be something like a reproducible document in Rstudio, or Python notebooks, etc
* **Content**. The compariso that they make on content isn't quite applicable to our purposes. 
* **Structure**. We could disucss examples or typical ways workflows are structured similar to the way they discuss structuring a MOOC

* Nice quote from last section on _Future of data science education_.: 
> _"Most​ ​importantly​ ​the​ ​large​ ​majority​ ​of​ ​traditional​ ​data​ ​science​ ​programs​ ​target​ ​one​ ​major audience​ ​-​ ​technically​ ​minded​ ​undergraduate​ ​or​ ​early​ ​graduate​ ​students.​ ​But​ ​there​ ​is​ ​a​ ​major opportunity​ ​to​ ​develop​ ​data​ ​literacy​ ​beyond​ ​these​ ​groups​ ​-​ ​both​ ​extending​ ​earlier​ ​in​ ​the curriculum​ ​and​ ​reaching​ ​across​ ​different​ ​disciplines.​"_

#### Title 

Useful tools to teach data science: workflows, case studies, GitHub Classroom, and Slack

#### Abstract 

An increase in demand for training in statistics and data science has led to an increase in computing, but this is not sufficient for teaching these topics. This talk will discuss a successful framework for teaching statistics and data science (described by Nolan and Speed in 1999) using in-depth workflows and case studies derived from interesting problems, with nontrivial solutions that leave room for different analyses. We will also discuss other useful tools for teaching data science, including GitHub Classroom and Slack. Finally, we discuss how these tools have been used to democratize data science to gender and ethnic minority populations that struggle to enter the field.

#### Title 

[Publishing literate programming workflows in scientific journals](https://bit.ly/prog-lit-workflow)

#### Abstract 

Literate programming workflows, in which the code used to perform the analysis is embedded within a manuscript or technical report (e.g. Rmarkdown, Sweave, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.), have gained recent attention with the availability of open source software facilitating the creation and publication of these documents, and journals interested in publishing such manuscripts. The idea of literate-programming-style workflows has been simmering for more than 30 years. We will discuss the publication of these type of workflows in scientific journals, how they are used to communicate scientific results and how they signal new types of scholarship.

#### Title 

When should you add GitHub, Make and Docker to your data science workflow?

#### Abstract 

Without deliberate and conscious effort towards organization, tool choice, and process, complex and large data science projects can quickly grow out-of-hand and become irreproducible. This talk will discuss when and why one should add tools such as GitHub, Make and Docker to their data science workflow to mitigate chaos and maximize transparency, reproducibility, and productivity.
