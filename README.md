title: "Democratizing Data Science with Workflows"

This repo contains a manuscript that we are writing to describe how 
workflows can be used to democratize data science, such as in 
research, teaching, publications and outreach. 

We plan to present these ideas at SDSS 2019 (see [notes](notes.md)
for the title and abstracts). 

The manuscript is [content](/content) folder.
