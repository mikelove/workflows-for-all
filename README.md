# Democratizing Data Science with Workflows

* Workflows are transparent, therefore tend toward inclusion
* Encourage learning by copy-and-change
* Workflows can be forked and pull-request-ed: a living document

## Workflows in Research

## Workflows in Teachings

## Workflows as Publications

* *F1000Research* Bioconductor workflows as case study
    - Technical aspect: Rmd to LaTeX, send to Overleaf
    - Reviewing timeline and rules
    - Example workflows
    - Afterlife as a publication
    - What is the currency in the community? In industry? In academia?
